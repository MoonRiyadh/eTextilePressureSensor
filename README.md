# Project Title:  
Capacitive Textile Sensing (CTS):An e-Textile for sensing the applied pressure on body to measure motor-neurological response in Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
## Name: H T M A Riyadh
## Course: Interactive System course project, Saarland University
# Project Concept:
Glasgo Coma Scale is used to asses a patient's consciousness level based on the neurological scale. Emergency medical services, nurses, physicians use GCS for assessing consciousness of patients mainly neck/head injured or trauma patients. The score level is 1 to 15. It is the initial stage of assessing neurological injured also known as traumatic brain injury patients. There are three main elements for this scale: eye, verbal and motor response. In this project I only consider the pressure input that is related to the eye and motor response. Verbal response is out of scope of this project.
# The sensor
We need a sensor that can measure the pressure or pressure sensitive. I proposed smart e-Fabric, that can able to measure the pressure applied on it. To implement this type of intelligent clothes sensor, we need conductive and piezo resistive textile fabric. This type of clothes already available on the market. We need the following components are needed to make our pressure sensor.
- Non-conductive fabric for outer layer. For the top layer, glue must be bottom face and the Bottom layer, glue must be up face.
- Non-conductive thicker fabric for making the structure of the sensor and it must be non-elastic. 
- Conductive Fabric. It should not be elastic. 
- Piezo-resistive Fabric. It is highly conductive and pressure sensitive.
- Both side bonded tape or clothes that can attach all the clothes together.

# Steps of making sensor (prototype):
1. Cut out a piece of bonding material (Iron on glue) about the same size of the material I intended to use
2. Then place the fabric(non conductive) and on top of that place bonding material
3. Start ironing them so that they bond together, then take of the paper from the top of bonding material
4. Place the conductive material on top of it and start iron for 6-8 seconds. (So we have conductive material bonding with the non conductive material)
5. Now place a resistive material on it. Remember no glue will be attached to resistive to conductive material
6. On top of it, place second conductive material and ten followed by a bonding material.
7. Then, on top of it place non conductive material and iron on it.
